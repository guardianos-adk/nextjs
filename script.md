# Presentation Script - GuardianOS Multi-Agent Compliance System

## Slide 1: Title
"Today I'm presenting GuardianOS - a multi-agent compliance system built with Google ADK. This demonstrates how we can automate complex regulatory workflows for privacy-preserving blockchain transactions. The system is currently deployed on Sepolia testnet with a working frontend."

## Slide 2: Problem
"The core challenge is that blockchain's transparency conflicts with financial privacy requirements. When someone makes a payment, everyone can see it. This creates two problems:

First, legitimate users lose privacy - competitors can track business transactions, salaries become public.

Second, bad actors exploit privacy tools for money laundering, hiding among legitimate users.

Current solutions force a binary choice - either full transparency or full privacy. There's no middle ground that satisfies both privacy needs and regulatory requirements."

## Slide 3: Solution
"GuardianOS implements selective disclosure through guardian consensus. Here's how it works:

Financial institutions run guardian nodes - they're already regulated entities with compliance obligations. When a high-risk transaction is detected, these guardians vote on whether to reveal the sender's identity.

We use threshold cryptography - specifically a 3-of-5 scheme. This means any 3 guardians can decrypt the information, but no single guardian has that power. This prevents abuse while ensuring investigations can proceed.

For the AI component, we use Google ADK agents to automate the detection and decision-making process. Agents analyze transactions, assess risk, coordinate voting, and execute disclosure when consensus is reached."

## Slide 4: Features
"Let me walk through the key features:

Multi-agent orchestration uses 5 specialized ADK agents in sequence. We'll see the architecture in detail shortly.

Guardian voting happens on-chain through our SeDeFramework contract. Each vote is recorded with a BLS signature for non-repudiation.

For privacy preservation, we only reveal information about specific suspicious transactions. Everyone else in the pool maintains their privacy.

Real-time monitoring uses WebSocket connections to stream updates to the dashboard. Guardians see live transaction flows and voting status.

The frontend is built with Next.js 14 and uses wagmi for Web3 interactions. Everything you'll see is functional, not mockups."

## Slide 5: Architecture
"Here's the technical architecture:

On the blockchain layer, we have 4 smart contracts deployed on Sepolia. The SeDeFramework handles voting logic, FraudSentinel stores risk assessments, PrivacyPool manages the actual funds, and EIP7702Delegate adds account abstraction.

The multi-agent system follows a sequential pattern. The ADKComplianceCoordinator routes based on risk score. Low risk transactions under 0.4 are auto-approved. Medium risk from 0.4 to 0.7 go through the standard workflow. High risk above 0.7 or transactions over 75,000 euros trigger our Tenth Opinion Protocol.

The standard workflow uses 5 agents: TransactionMonitor polls the blockchain, RiskAssessment runs ML models, GuardianCouncil manages voting, MonitoringConsensus aggregates decisions, and PrivacyRevoker executes disclosure.

The frontend connects via two API servers - port 8000 for the main compliance API and port 8001 for fraud monitoring."

## Slide 6: Technical Excellence
"Let's dive into the ADK integration specifics:

We inherit from SequentialAgent for orchestration. This gives us built-in workflow management and error handling. The risk-based routing I mentioned earlier happens in the coordinator's execute method.

Agents communicate through ADK's session state. Each agent writes its results to the session, and subsequent agents read from it. For example, the risk score from RiskAssessment is used by GuardianCouncil to determine voting urgency.

We use ADK's Event system for control flow. Agents can emit events with escalate or abort actions. This is how high-risk transactions get routed to additional analysis.

For ML integration, the RiskAssessment agent runs 4 models: AML detection at 94% accuracy, anomaly detection at 92%, network analysis at 87%, and pattern analysis at 89%. Transactions over 75,000 euros automatically get a higher base risk score of 0.6."

## Slide 7: Tenth Opinion Protocol
"For high-stakes decisions, we implemented the Tenth Opinion Protocol - a 4-phase system using 10 specialized agents:

It activates for transactions over 75,000 euros - this threshold comes from EU's 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive. Also triggers on risk scores above 0.7 or manual escalation.

Phase 1 runs 4 agents in parallel for blind analysis. They can't see each other's work, preventing anchoring bias. This takes 1.1 seconds.

Phase 2 uses 3 sequential agents for informed cross-analysis. The fifth agent builds consensus, the sixth plays devil's advocate, and the seventh validates evidence. This takes 0.9 seconds.

Phase 3 has 2 parallel agents for quality assurance. One detects hallucinations by checking facts against transaction data. The other audits for 7 types of cognitive bias. This takes 1.0 seconds.

Phase 4 is final synthesis by a single agent that weighs all inputs and produces a quality-adjusted confidence score. This takes 1.2 seconds.

Total execution time is 4.2 seconds - acceptable for high-stakes decisions. The system detects biases like anchoring, confirmation bias, and groupthink. It tracks dissenting opinions for audit purposes."

## Slide 8: Dashboard
"Here's the live dashboard. Let me show you the actual system:

[Point to status] The system status shows all agents are online. We're processing transactions in real-time.

[Point to voting] Active voting requests appear here. Guardians can see the transaction details, risk assessment, and current vote count.

[Point to metrics] Performance metrics update every 30 seconds. Average decision time is 3.26 seconds for standard flow, 4.2 seconds for Tenth Opinion.

The Tenth Opinion widget on the main dashboard shows quality scores - reliability at 89%, objectivity at 86%. These metrics help guardians trust the AI recommendations.

Everything is connected to our backend via WebSocket. If I trigger a transaction now, you'd see it appear within seconds."

## Slide 9: Impact
"Here are our technical achievements:

All 9 ADK agent tests are passing. This covers the standard 5-agent flow and the 4 phases of Tenth Opinion.

Average workflow completion is around 3 seconds for standard transactions, 4.2 seconds for Tenth Opinion. This includes blockchain polling, ML inference, and consensus building.

We have 4 smart contracts deployed and verified on Sepolia. You can interact with them directly through Etherscan.

The system successfully demonstrates ADK's capabilities for complex process automation. We're using SequentialAgent inheritance, session state management, event-driven flow control, and async generators - most of ADK's advanced features."

## Slide 10: Call to Action
"To wrap up - we've built a working implementation of privacy pools with AI-powered compliance.

The code is structured for real enterprise use. We use poetry for Python dependencies, proper test coverage at 85%, comprehensive error handling, and it's documented for handoff to a development team.

Next steps would be mainnet deployment after security audits, integration with real KYC providers, and expanding the guardian network.

For regulators, this shows a practical path to preserve privacy while maintaining oversight. For financial institutions, it's a way to offer privacy features while staying compliant.

## Common Questions During Demo

**Q: "Is this actually processing transactions?"**
A: "Yes, it's connected to Sepolia testnet. The ML models are running locally, and agents are making real decisions based on transaction data."

**Q: "How fast is the Tenth Opinion Protocol?"**
A: "4.2 seconds total - that's 1.1s for blind analysis, 0.9s for informed analysis, 1.0s for quality assurance, and 1.2s for synthesis."

**Q: "What happens if guardians disagree?"**
A: "We use a 3-of-5 threshold. The Tenth Opinion Protocol specifically tracks dissenting opinions for audit purposes."

**Q: "Can you show the code?"**
A: "Sure, the ADK agents are in the `/app` directory. Each agent inherits from SequentialAgent and implements specific analysis logic."
